# InefficientSchoolConnectKeyGen
Long name. Takes long time to crack accounts. Yep. For this website https://scweb.burnabyschools.ca/
Basically, the program just iterates through a number of keywords, added with a number, in alphabetical order. 
This process is very, very slow, and when ran in one browser tab, will take a maximum of 2 hours to crack one account.
Unfortunately, since I suck at programming, it simulates key presses to input the data, slowing down the process even more.
